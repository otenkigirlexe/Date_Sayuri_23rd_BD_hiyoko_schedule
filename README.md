### What is this?ðŸ‘€

<p>My favorite, Sayuri Date's birthday event has been announced again this year!</p>
<p>This year, there will be two performances: one in Tokyo and one in Osaka.</p>
<p>I've created this repository to help manage the schedule!</p>

### How to useðŸ¤—

<p>Only I need to know.</p>
<p>I mean, don't look at it too much lol.</p>

### Fees and transportation costsðŸ’°

<p>The itinerary should start from Tokyo station for each performance and go to each venue.</p>
<p>The starting point for the transportation fee can be changed for convenience.</p>
<p>Additional information such as serial numbers, serial fees, etc., if any, should be written in the remarks column.</p>
